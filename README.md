# React Router Dom v6 - Unexpected Route Matching Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router Dom v6 where routes containing nested elements, specifically forms, might not match correctly, even with a proper path. This can lead to unexpected rendering behavior.

## Bug Description
Nested routes inside a parent component containing a form might not trigger correctly. The component may render the wrong component, or simply not render at all, even if the URL matches the expected route path. This seems particularly common in nested routes.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You might find that the About component isn't rendering correctly, even though the URL is accurate.  Try adding more nested Routes to exacerbate the issue.

## Solution
The proposed solution involves several potential workarounds, explained in `bugSolution.js`.
